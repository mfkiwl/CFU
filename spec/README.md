_Draft Proposed_ Composable Custom Extensions Specification
===========================================================

This document comprises draft proposed specifications for
hardware-software and hardware-hardware interfaces, formats, and metadata,
enabling independent, efficient, and robust composition of diverse
composable custom instruction set extensions, composable extension units
hardware, and composable extension libraries software.

It is a work in progress. We request your feedback.

At present this is not a work product of a RISC-V International SIG, Task
Group, or subcommittee.  Rather we share this work in the hope that it
may motivate and inform a RISC-V International Task Group for a
CX-ISA composable extensions extension, plus non-ISA
(CX API, CX ABI, CXU logic interface) interoperation interface standards.

(Pending standardization, implementers might elect to implement the
present specifications as their own _custom extension_.)

This work summarizes years of ongoing discussions and prototyping by
(alphabetical order): Tim Ansell, Tim Callahan, Jan Gray, Karol Gugala,
Olof Kingdren, Maciej Kurc, Guy Lemieux, Charles Papon, Zdenek Prikryl, Tim Vogt.
