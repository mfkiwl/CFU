=== Version 0.95.240403, 2024-04-03: Add CX CSRs

Add CX-scoped custom CSRs:

1. Extend CX multiplexing to multiplex _both_ custom opcode instructions
and now also custom CSR access instructions.

2. Extend CXU-LI to convey CX CSR access requests and responses.

3. Change `cx_imm` CX custom function instruction format to follow the
format of `addi` and `csrrw`, with a 12-bit imm field.

4. Rename `mcx_selector.cte` to `mcx_selector.cxe` (_custom operation
exception enable_) -- enables illegal-instruction exceptions on use of
custom operations; resize `mcx_selector.version` from 4-bits to 3-bits.

=== Version 0.94.240327, 2024-03-27: Add mcx_selector.cte.

Add `mcx_selector.cte`, _custom operation trap enable_.

This enables emulation of absent custom instructions, emulation of
absent composable extensions, and virtualization of stateful composable
extensions state contexts.

=== Version 0.93.240310, 2024-03-10: Revise CX ABI.

Add a CX ABI chapter. Update CX ABI section of Introduction.

The old CX ABI was _callee-save_ management of the CX mux CSRs,
optimizing for minimum CX mux CSR writes.

The new CX ABI is _ambient legacy mode_, maximally paranoid and backwards
compatible, keeping CX muxing _off_ (e.g., selecting for legacy built-in
custom extensions) except when actively issuing CX custom instructions.

=== Version 0.92.231111, 2023-11-11: Add extension multiplexing _version_.

Introduce _CX version, improving CX forward compatibility. Replace
`mcx_selector.en` with `mcx_selector.version`. Add `cx_status.iv` error
field. Replace `cx_status` field names CI/SI/FI with IC/IS/IF.

=== Version 0.91.230803, 2023-08-03: Simplify and improve terminology.

Replace term _Custom Interface (CI)_ with _Composable Extension (CX)_.
Similarly replace _CFU_ with _CXU_.
And so forth.
