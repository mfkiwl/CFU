== Custom interfaces: the hardware-software interface

The Custom Interface abstraction bridges software and hardware, enabling
diverse software libraries which target the same interface and
diverse hardware CFU cores which implement the same interface. Then
_custom interface multiplexing_ enables composition of systems of
separately authored and versioned components.

=== Definitions

A *custom function (CF)* is a function from two integer operands to an
integer result and response status. May be stateless or stateful.

[[CF_ID]]
A *custom function identifier (CF_ID)* is an integer, in the scope of
a custom interface, identifying a custom function. A *valid CF_ID* is
a value that identifies a CF instruction implemented by a configured
interface.

A *stateless custom function* is a CF that is a pure function of
its operands (only). Never reads nor writes any other architected
state. Given the same operand values, always produces the same result
and response status.

A *stateful custom function* is a CF that is a function of its operands
and its custom interface state context (only). May read and write the
context but never reads or writes other architected state. Equivalently:
a CF that is a function of its operands and of any prior CF invocations
upon its custom interface (only).

A *custom interface (CI, interface)* is a fixed named set of custom
functions. May be stateless or stateful. _Fixed:_ immutable, i.e., any
versioning of the CFs or the behavior of an interface necessarily defines
a new interface. _Named:_ has a custom interface identifier.

A *custom interface identifier (CI_ID)* is a 128-bit globally unique ID
(_GUID_) [see RFC-4122], unique in history, identifying a custom
interface__.__

A *stateless custom interface* is a fixed named set of set of stateless
custom functions.

A *stateful custom interface* is a fixed named set of custom functions,
at least one of which is a stateful custom function, plus a custom
interface state context.

A *custom interface state context (state context, state, context)*
is an isolated collection of state associated with a stateful custom
interface. Isolated: stateful custom functions of the interface may read
and write the state context, but no other element or operation of the
system may read or write the state context.

[[serializable]]
*`IStateContext`* is a stateful custom interface, identified as
`CI_ID_IStateContext`, and with four stateful custom functions:
{`cf_read_status`, `cf_write_status`, `cf_read_state`, `cf_write_state` },
providing a standard way to manage a custom interface state context. A
*serializable custom interface* is a stateful custom interface that
inherits IStateContext.

A *configured custom interface (configured interface)* is an interface
that is configured (included) within a system and is implemented by a
CFU of the system (a *configured CFU*). Within a system, a configured
interface has some configured number of state contexts.

A *configured interface subset* is a configured interface in which one
or more custom functions of the interface are not implemented. The CF_IDs
of unimplemented custom functions are invalid.

[[STATE_ID]]
A *custom interface state context identifier (STATE_ID)* is an integer
index, in the scope of a configured interface, in the range [0,
no. of state contexts-1] identifying one of an interface's contexts
in the system. A stateless interface has zero state contexts and uses
STATE_ID=0 whenever a STATE_ID is required. A *valid STATE_ID* is a
value that identifies a state context of a configured interface.

A *custom function instruction (CF instruction)* is a RISC-V custom
instruction that executes a custom function using a custom function
unit, sourcing the integer operands from the register file and/or from
an immediate field of the instruction, writing the integer result to the
register file, and updating the CFU status CSR with the response status.

A *custom function unit (CFU)* is a core that implements one or more
custom interfaces. A *stateful CFU* implements at least one stateful
custom interface.

[[CFU_ID]]
A *CFU_ID* is an integer, in the scope of a system, that identifies
a configured interface implemented by a CFU. When one CFU implements
multiple configured interfaces, different CFU_IDs identify the configured
interfaces. A *valid CFU_ID* is a CFU_ID value that identifies a
configured interface.

A *custom interface selector (CI selector, selector)* is a 32-bit value
written to `mcfu_selector` CSR to enable custom interface multiplexing
and specify the hart's current configured interface / CFU and current
state context.

[[selector-table]]
A *CI selector table* is a 4 KB aligned, 4 KB sized table of 1024
CI selectors. When CFU access control (ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>) is
supported, each hart has a `mcfu_selector_table` CSR to address its CI
selector table.

A *selector index* is an integer that identifies an entry in a CI selector
table (ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>).

[[cfu_csrs]]
=== New CFU control / status registers

A -Zicfu compatible CPU shall implement the `mcfu_selector` and
`cfu_status` CSRs for interface multiplexing and custom function
execution.

When CFU access control
(ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>)
is supported, a -Zicfu compatible CPU
shall implement the `mcfu_selector_table` and `cfu_selector_index` CSRs.

All CFU CSR fields marked _reserved_ are WPRI, write preserve, read
ignored, and all other fields are WARL, write any/read legal values. (An
invalid <<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>> or <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>> value is still _legal_).

All CFU CSRs are initialized to zero on reset.

==== `mcfu_selector` CSR 0xBC0: select active CFU and state context

The `mcfu_selector` CSR implements custom interface multiplexing. It
is assigned various CI selectors over time. This enables or disables
CI multiplexing and selects the hart's current CFU and state context
(within that CFU). It may only be read or written in machine level.

[NOTE]
====
In a privileged architecture system, user level read access to
`mcfu_selector` values could reveal goings-on in other software threads
and thus facilitate side channel attacks.
====

[NOTE]
====
In a privileged architecture with M/S/U levels, for example, what CSRs
are required and what access permissions should they have?
====

.`mcfu_selector` CSR 0xBC0
[wavedrom,target="`mcfu_selector`",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 8, name: 'cfu_id'},
{bits: 8, name: 'reserved', type:1, vspace:88},
{bits: 8, name: 'state_id'},
{bits: 7, name: 'reserved', type:1},
{bits: 8, name: 'en'},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32}
}
....

The `mcfu_selector` CSR has the following fields:

`.en`: enable custom interface multiplexing

* When `en=0`, disable custom interface multiplexing. The `cfu_id`
and `state_id` fields are ignored. No CFU is selected. `Custom-0`,
`custom-1`, or `custom-2` instructions execute the CPU's built-in
custom instructions.

* When `en=1`, enable custom interface multiplexing. The
`cfu_id` and `state_id` fields select the current CFU and state
context. `Custom-0`/`-1`/`-2` instructions issue CFU requests to the CFU
identified by `cfu_id` and to the state context identified by `state_id`.

`.cfu_id`: select the hart's current CFU

* A valid `cfu_id` identifies a configured CFU.

* When enabled, when `cfu_id` does not identify a configured CFU, executing
a CF instruction causes an invalid CFU_ID error. The `cfu_status.CI`
error bit is set and the CF instruction's destination register, if any,
is zeroed.

`.state_id`: select the hart's current CFU's current state context

* A valid `state_id` identifies a state context of a CFU.

* When enabled, when `cfu_id` is valid, but `state_id` does not identify
a state context of the current CFU, executing a CF instruction causes
an invalid STATE_ID error. The `cfu_status.SI` error bit is set and the
CF instruction's destination register, if any, is zeroed.

No error occurs when `mcfu_selector` is CSR-written with an invalid
CI selector, i.e., when `.cfu_id` or `.state_id` are invalid. Rather,
subsequently executing a CF instruction may cause a CFU_ID or STATE_ID
error.

[[cfu_status]]
==== `cfu_status` CSR 0x801: CFU status

The `cfu_status` CSR accumulates CFU error flags. It may be written and
read in all privilege levels.

Typical application software will write a CI selector to `mcfu_selector`,
write 0 to `cfu_status`, execute some CF instructions, and read
`cfu_status` to determine if there were any errors.

.`cfu_status` CSR 0x801
[wavedrom,target="`cfu_status`",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits:1, name:'CI'},
{bits:1, name:'SI'},
{bits:1, name:'OF'},
{bits:1, name:'FI', attr:'accrued errors'},
{bits:1, name:'OP'},
{bits:1, name:'CU'},
{bits: 26, name: 'reserved', type:1},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

The `cfu_status` CSR has the following fields:

`.CI`: invalid CFU_ID error

* Set by a CF instruction when `mcfu_selector.cfu_id` is invalid.

`.SI`: invalid STATE_ID error

* Set by a CF instruction when `mcfu_selector.cfu_id` is valid but
`mcfu_selector`.state_id is invalid.

`.OF`: state context is off error

* Set by a CF instruction when `mcfu_selector.cfu_id` and
`mcfu_selector.state_id` are valid but the selected state context is in
the <<off-state,_off_>> state.

`.FI`: invalid CF_ID error

* Set by a CF instruction when `mcfu_selector.cfu_id` and
`mcfu_selector.state_id` are valid but the instruction's CF_ID is invalid.

`.OP`: CFU operation error

* Set by a CF instruction when `mcfu_selector.cfu_id`,
`mcfu_selector.state_id`, and its CF_ID are valid but there is an error
in the requested operation or its operands, in lieu of custom error state.

`.CU`: custom CFU operation error

* Set by a CF instruction of a stateful interface when
`mcfu_selector.cfu_id`, `mcfu_selector.state_id`, and its CF_ID are
valid but there is an error in the requested operation or its operands,
with custom (interface-defined) error state available.

[TIP]
====
The custom error state of a stateful interface may be obtained using
custom functions of the interface. In addition, the custom error state
of a serializable interface may also be obtained using
<<IStateContext,`IStateContext`>>
custom functions `cf_read_status` and/or `cf_read_state`.
====

==== `mcfu_selector_table` CSR 0xBC1: CFU selector table base

When CFU access control (ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>) is supported, the
`MXLEN`-bit-wide `mcfu_selector_table` CSR specifies the base address
of the hart's CI selector table. The CSR may be read and written in
machine level.

.mcfu_selector_table CSR 0xBC1 (when MXLEN=32)
[wavedrom,target="cfu_selector_table",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 12, name: '0'},
{bits: 20, name: 'base_page'},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

CSR-writes to `mcfu_selector_table` zero the twelve least significant
bits of the table address, so a CI selector table address must be 4
KB aligned.

==== `cfu_selector_index` CSR 0x800: CFU selector index

When CFU access control (ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>)  is supported, the
`cfu_selector_index` CSR selects an entry from the hart's CI selector
table entry to write to the `mcfu_selector` CSR. The CSR may be read
and written in all privilege levels.

.cfu_selector_index CSR 0x800
[wavedrom,target="cfu_selector_index",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 10, name: 'index'},
{bits:22, name:'reserved', type:1}
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

The 10-bit zero-extended index field specifies which entry in the hart's
CI selector table (at the hart's `mcfu_selector_table`) to use as the
hart's current CI selector.

In response to CSR-write of `cfu_selector_index`, load the 32-bit CI
selector at address (`mcfu_selector_table + cfu_selector_index.index*4`)
and CSR-write the CI selector to `mcfu_selector`, performing the load
and the CSR-write at the next higher privilege level, as if it were
a `lw` instruction (and with a `lw` instruction's memory ordering
rules) (ยง<<_cfu_access_control>>).

==== Implicit CFU CSR fences

Per hart, there is an implicit fence between any CFU CSR access and any
series of `custom-0`/`-1`/`-2` instructions. All CFU CSR accesses happen
before any CF instructions which follow, and all CF instructions happen
before any CFU CSR accesses that follow.

[TIP]
====
For example, after issuing a long latency CF instruction, a CSR read of
`cfu_status` must await the CF instruction's CFU response.
====

=== Custom function instruction encodings

When `mcfu_selector.en=1`, software issues CF instructions to the current
state context of the current interface (i.e., of the current configured
CFU) using R-type, I-type, and flex-type custom function instruction
encodings.

For each instruction encoding, the CF instruction specifies the CF_ID, and
source operand values, which may be two source registers, or one source
register and one immediate value. R-type and I-type instructions always
write a destination register whereas flex-type instructions never do so.

==== Custom-0 R-type encoding

Assembly instruction: `cfu_reg cf_id,rd,rs1,rs2`

An R-type CF instruction issues a CFU request for a zero-extended 10-bit
CF_ID `cf_id` with two source register operands identified by `rs1` and
`rs2`. The CFU response data is written to destination register `rd`.

.CFU R-type instruction encoding
[wavedrom,target="custom-0",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name:11, attr: 'custom-0'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 'cf_id[2:0]'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1',},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs2'},
{bits: 7, name: 'cf_id[9:3]'},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

==== Custom-1 I-type encoding

Assembly instruction: `cfu_imm cf_id,rd,rs1,imm`

An I-type CF instruction issues a CFU request for a zero-extended 4-bit
CF_ID `cf_id` with one source register operand identified by `rs1` and a
signed-extended 8-bit immediate value `imm`. The CFU response is written
to destination register `rd`.

.CFU I-type instruction encoding
[wavedrom,target="custom-1",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name: 43, attr:'custom-1'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1'},
{bits: 4, name: 'cf_id[3:0]'},
{bits: 8, name: 'imm[7:0]'},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

[NOTE]
====
This new, irregular immediate field encoding may have a disproportionate
impact on area and critical path delay in the decode or execute pipeline
stages of a RISC-V processor core.
====

Seven-eighths of the custom-1 encoding space is reserved for future
custom function instruction encodings.

.CFU reserved I-type instruction encodings

{bits: 3, name: '1-7'},
{bits: 17, name: 'reserved', type:1},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

[[custom-2]]
==== Custom-2 flex-type encoding

Assembly instruction: `cfu_flex cf_id,rs1,rs2` +
Assembly instruction: `cfu_flex25 custom`

A flex-type CF instruction issues a CFU request for a zero-extended
10-bit CF_ID `cf_id` with two source register operands identified by
`rs1` and `rs2`. There is no destination register and CFU response _data_
(but not a possible _error status_) is discarded. The instruction is
executed purely for its effect upon the selected state context of the
selected CFU.

.CFU flex-type instruction encoding
[wavedrom,target="custom-2",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name:91, attr: 'custom-2'},
{bits: 5, name: 'custom' },
{bits: 3, name: 'cf_id[2:0]'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1',},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs2'},
{bits: 7, name: 'cf_id[9:3]'},
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

Alternatively, equivalently, the `cfu_flex25` form of instruction issues
an arbitrary 25-bit custom instruction.

.CFU flex-type instruction alternate encoding
[wavedrom,target="custom-2-alt",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name:91, attr: 'custom-2'},
{bits: 25, name: 'custom' },
],
config: {lanes: 1, bits: 32},
}
....

[TIP]
====
A flex-type CF instruction may be used with a CFU-L2 request's raw
instruction field `req_insn` (<<raw-insn>>) to provide an
arbitrary 32-7=25-bit custom request to a CFU. The absence of an
(integer) destination register field is a feature that provides added,
CPU-uninterpreted, custom instruction bits to a CFU.
====

[TIP]
====
One disadvantage of this approach: when the selected CFU routinely
discards the R[`rs1`] or R[`rs2`] operands, use of the flex-type custom
function instruction can create a useless false dependency on the `rs1`
and `rs2` registers, which may uselessly delay issue of the CF instruction
in an out-of-order CPU core.
====

[[multiplexing]]
=== Custom function instruction execution via custom interface multiplexing

<<execution>> illustrates how a custom function instruction and the CFU
CSRs implement custom interface / CFU composition via custom interface
multiplexing. When the CPU issues a custom function instruction,
it produces a <<cfu_request,CFU request>> from the fields of the
instruction, two source operands from the register file and/or an
immediate field of the instruction, and the `cfu_id` and `state_id` fields
of `mcfu_selector`. The CFU request may include the request ID cookie
(defined by the CPU), the <<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>, <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>,
raw instruction, <<CF_ID,CF_ID>>, and operands. The CFU_ID identifies
which CFU must process the request. The CFU includes state context(s)
and a datapath. The STATE_ID selects the state context to use for this
request. The CFU checks for errors in CFU_ID, STATE_ID, and CF_ID
per <<cfu_status>>, processes the request, possibly updating this
state context, and produces a CFU response, which may include the same
request ID cookie, a success/error status, and the response data. The
CPU commits the custom function instruction by updating `cfu_status`
(when response status is an error condition) and writing the response
data to the destination register.

[[execution]]
.HW-SW interface: flow of information for execution of a custom function instruction
image::cf-instruction-execution.png[image,width=360]

Multiple custom function instructions may be in flight at the same time,
particularly in a system with pipelined CPUs or pipelined CFUs. A CPU
may send a request ID and later receive the (same) ID back to correlate
requests sent and responses received.

<<mapping>> defines the mapping from HW-SW interface entities, such as
the `cf_id`, `rd`, `rs1`, `rs2`, `imm` fields of the custom function instruction
and the `mcfu_select` and `cfu_status` CSRs, to the CFU Logic Interface's
request and response signals
(ยง<<_cfu_li_signaling>>).

[[mapping]]

|`resp_id` | -> CPU
|`resp_status` | -> `cfu_status` bits
|`resp_data` | -> R[`insn.rd`] {`custom-0`/`-1`}
|===

==== Precise exceptions

Custom function instruction execution preserves precise exception
semantics. If an instruction preceding (in execution order) a custom
function instruction is an exception, the custom function instruction
does not execute, and has no effect upon architected state, including
the `cfu_status` CSR, and no effect on the current state context of the
custom interface / CFU.

If an instruction following (in execution order) a custom function
instruction is an exception, the custom function instruction executes,
updating destination register, `cfu_status`, and current state context,
as appropriate.

[TIP]
====
A CPU may speculatively issue a CF instruction to a stateless
CFU. Misspeculation recovery entails completing and discarding the CFU
response. The CF instruction does not commit and there is no change to
architectural state.
====

[TIP]
====
A CPU may not speculatively issue a CF instruction to a stateful CFU
because the instruction may update the current state context and the
CFU Logic Interface has no means to cancel a CFU request. In other
words, a CF instruction of a stateful CFU, once issued, always commits.
====

[TIP]
====
Speculation is more than branch prediction. For example, in a pipelined
CPU, instructions that follow a load or store instruction typically
issue speculatively until the load or store is determined to not raise
an access fault. CF instructions of stateful CFUs must not issue in the
wake of an instruction that may yet trap.
====

[TIP]
====
When a long latency CF instruction issues and a pipelined CPU continues
issuing the following instructions in its wake, and one traps, the CPU
nevertheless commits the CF instruction when the CFU eventually sends
the response.
====

[NOTE]
====
How can a CPU core determine dynamically whether a CF instruction, or its custom interface, is stateless?

A software-defined approach could decorate the specification of a custom function to indicate
whether it is stateful or stateless, and to encode this as an opcode bit
in the `custom-0`/`-1`/`-2` instructions. Then a CPU may safely speculatively issue
stateless CF instructions but non-speculatively issue stateful CF instructions.

A hardware-defined approach could add to the request and response streams
defined in <<cfu-li,CFU-LI>>, a third stream, called the _commit stream_.
This enables a CPU to speculatively issue any CF instruction and issue
its CFU request, then later, when speculation is resolved, issue its
commit token or cancel token.  A stateful CFU, receiving and performing a
CFU request, would defer from updating any CFU state until the request's
corresponding commit token arrives.
====

[[IStateContext]]
=== `IStateContext`: the standard custom functions

The `IStateContext` custom interface defines four standard custom
functions to manage interface state context data. Stateful custom
interfaces should (albeit not _must_) inherit from this interface,
i.e., incorporate these four custom functions. `IStateContext` provides
a standard, uniform way to access the interface's custom error state
and enables an interface-agnostic runtime or operating system to reset,
save, and reload state contexts.

.Standard stateful custom functions
[width="100%",cols="20%,8%,30%,42%",options="header",]
|===
|*Custom function* |*CF_ID* |*Assembly instruction* |*Encoding*
|`cf_read_status` |1023 |`cfu_read_status rd` |`cfu_reg 1023,rd,x0,x0`
|`cf_write_status` |1022 |`cfu_write_status rs1` |`cfu_reg 1022,x0,rs1,x0`
|`cf_read_state` |1021 |`cfu_read_state rd,rs1` |`cfu_reg 1021,rd,rs1,x0`
|`cf_write_state` |1020 |`cfu_write_state rs1,rs2` |`cfu_reg 1020,x0,rs1,rs2`
|===

CF_IDs 1008-1023 (0x3F0-0x3FF) are reserved for standard custom
functions. It is recommended, not mandatory, that these CF_IDs not be
used for another purpose.

Any CF instruction with CF_ID=1023 must be side effect free, i.e.,
never modify any CFU state.

==== Interface state context status word

The `cf_read_status` and `cf_write_status` functions access the selected
interface state context's status word.

.CFU state context status word
[wavedrom,target="state-context-status-word",svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 2, name: 'cs'},
{bits: 10, name: 'state_size'},
{bits: 12, name: 'reserved', type:1},
{bits: 8, name: 'error'},
]}
....

The interface state context status word has the following fields:

`.cs`: context status

* The state context has four context status values: { 0: `off`; 1: `initial`;
2: `clean`; 3: `dirty` } which correspond to those of the `XS` field of the
`mstatus` CSR, per the RISC-V Privileged ISA specification
cite:[risc-v-priv(26)].

* On system reset, each state context of a serializable stateful interface
CFU is in the `initial` state.

[[off-state]]
* A write `.cs=0` has the side effect of explicitly turning off the
_current_ state context. In this state, all CF instructions except
`cf_write_status` and `cf_read_status` signal `CFU_ERROR_OFF`, until the state
context status is set to another state by a subsequent `cf_write_status`.

* A write `.cs=1` has the side effect of resetting the entire _current_
state context to its `initial` (power up) state.

* When a CF instruction modifies any aspect of the current state context of
a serializable CFU, its state context status automatically changes to
`dirty`.

`.state_size`: state context size

* This WARL field specifies the _current_ size (number of XLEN-sized words) of
the current state context.

* Reads return the current size of the current state context.

* The value read need not equal the last value written.

* Writes return the previous size and `cs` status of the current state context.

* Different CFU implementations of the same custom interface may have
different state context sizes.

* Different state contexts of the same CFU may have different state context sizes.

* At different times, the same state context of the same CFU may have different state context sizes.

`.error`: custom error status

* An 8-bit custom error status for the current interface / CFU and its state context.

[NOTE]
====
Define rules for what the interface can or must to with writes to this field.
Need a way to zero a custom error.
But this is not a free byte of storage per state context.
An implementation is permitted to implement this as constant 0, for example.
====

==== `cfu_read_status` standard custom function instruction

Assembly instruction: `cfu_read_status rd`

This instruction retrieves the state status word
(ยง<<_interface_state_context_status_word>>) of the selected state context
of the selected CFU and writes it to the `rd` destination register.

`cfu_read_status` can never modify the selected state context, nor modify
the behavior of the interface.

The status word `.state_size` field may change as a side effect of
executing a stateful CF instruction.

For the CF instruction sequence [ `cfu_read_status`; `cfu_read_state`*;
`cfu_read_status` ], the first and second `cfu_read_status` must return
the same `.state_size`.

For the CF instruction sequence [ `cfu_read_status`,
_any-other-CF-instruction_ *, `cfu_read_status` ], the first and second
`cfu_read_status` need not return the same `.state_size`.

[TIP]
====
For most stateful CFUs, the size of a state context is
fixed. For some stateful CFUs, the size of a state context may depend
upon the sequence of CF instructions performed. For example, a stateful
vector math CFU may provide CF instructions to allocate per-state context
vector storage from a common, private shared pool, and may allow different
state contexts to represent different sized vectors.
====

`cfu_read_status` may be used as a _probe_ after a `mcfu_selector` write,
to check whether the selector addresses a valid CFU and state context:

[source,asm]
....
csrw mfcu_selector,x1   ; select some CFU and state context
csrw cfu_status,x0      ; clear cfu_status
cfu_read_status x0      ; probe, discarding state status word
csrr x2,cfu_status      ; retrieve cfu_status
...                     ; cfu_status.ci => invalid CFU_ID
...                     ; cfu_status.si => invalid STATE_ID
....

==== `cfu_write_status` standard custom function instruction

Assembly instruction: `cfu_write_status rs1`

This instruction writes the value of the `rs1` source register to the
state status word of the selected state context of the selected CFU,
and writes the previous value of the state context status word to the
`rd` destination register.

A write `.cs=1` always has the side effect of resetting the selected
state context to its initial (power up) state.

For the sequence [ `cfu_write_status`; *; `cfu_read_status` ] the value of
`.state_size` read need not equal the last value written.

A `cfu_write_status` CF instruction never has any effect upon any other
state context of the CFU, or of any other CFU.

==== `cfu_read_state` standard custom function instruction

Assembly instruction: `cfu_read_state rd,rs1`

This instruction reads one (XLEN-bit) word of state, at the index
specified by the `rs1` source register, from the selected state context
of the selected CFU, and writes it to the `rd` destination register.

==== `cfu_write_state` standard custom function instruction

Assembly instruction: `cfu_write_state rs1,rs2`

This instruction reads the value of the `rs2` source register and writes
it to the selected state context of the selected CFU at the index
specified by the value of the `rs1` source register.
It also writes the value of the `rs2` source register to the `rd`
destination register. It silently drops attempts to write state at an
invalid state index.

=== Resource management and context switching

A software resource manager (e.g., thread pool, language runtime, language
virtual machine, RTOS, operating system, hypervisor) multiplexes software
loci of execution (e.g., request, worker, actor, activity, task, fiber,
continuation, thread, process), _locus_ for short, upon one or more
hardware threads (_harts_).

The RISC-V per-hart state includes the program counter and integer
register file, and optionally, floating point and vector register files,
and various CSRs. Composable interfaces extension *-Zicfu* extends
per-hart state with the CFU CSRs (ยง<<cfu_csrs>>) and the various
configured state contexts of the stateful configured custom interfaces.

A CFU implementing a stateful custom interface is typically configured
with one state context per hart in the entire system, but other
configurations, including one context per locus, or a small pool
of cooperatively or preemptively managed contexts, or several harts
sharing one context, or one singleton context, are possible. Similarly,
each CFU in a system may be configured with a different number of its
state contexts.

The resource manager maintains the mapping of loci to harts, and the
mapping of harts to (per-CFU) state contexts. The resource manager
consults a _system CFU map_ specifying the mapping CFU_IDs of the
configured interfaces of the system, and for each interface/CFU, the
no. of state contexts it is configured with. A stateless CFU has zero
contexts.

Over time, the resource manager must reset, save, and restore hart state,
including its interface state contexts, to initialize a hart or
to perform a context switch.

To reset hart state, for each interface state context of the hart, execute

[source,asm]
....
li a1,{.error=0,.cs=1/*initialize*/}
lw a0,selectors[i]
csrw mcfu_selector,a0
cfu_write_status a1
....

This resets that state context to its initial state. It is also necessary
to reset `cfu_status`.

[source,asm]
....
csrw cfu_status,x0
....

To save hart state, first save `cfu_status`, then
for each interface state context of the hart,
execute

[source,asm]
....
csrr a0,cfu_status
sw a0,saved_cfu_status
...
lw a0,selectors[i]
csrw mcfu_selector,a0
cfu_read_status a0
sw a0,status[i]
....

to obtain `.state_size`, the size (in XLEN-bit words) of the serialized
state context for the selected state context. Allocate array `save[i][]`
to store the serialized state context. For each word in `.state_size`,
execute

[source,asm]
....
cfu_read_state a0,j
sw/sd a0, save[i][j]
....

(When XLEN=32, use `sw`; when XLEN=64, use `sd`.)

To restore hart state, for each interface state context of the hart,
first execute

[source,asm]
....
lw a0, selectors[i]
csrw mcfu_selector, a0
lw a0, status[i]
cfu_write_status a0
....

to restore the state context status word. Then for each word in
`status[i].state_size`, execute

[source,asm]
....
lw/ld a0, save[i][j]
cfu_write_state j,a0
....

to restore each word of the state context. Finally restore the
saved `cfu_status`.

[source,asm]
....
lw a0,saved_cfu_status
csrw cfu_status,a0
....

When different CFUs implement the same custom interface, they may have
different serializations, of different sizes.

[NOTE]
====
Discuss preemption scenario where following context save, later restore,
the locus moves to a different STATE_ID of a CFU.  `cfu_selector_index`
may (but should not) change.  However, resource manager must change
`mcfu_selector`.
====

[NOTE]
====
`cf_read_state` and `cf_write_state` are random access. It is
possible this induces unnecessary CFU hardware area. Perhaps specify a
stream-out/stream-in interface instead.
====

[NOTE]
====
Discuss impact of mixed sized serialized contexts upon system code and
upon CFU design. Can a serialized state context ever be too big to reload?
====

[NOTE]
====
Is it necessary or helpful for CFU metadata to declare fixed- or
variable-sized interface state contexts?

=== CFU access control

Fully trusted software, executing in machine level, has full access
to every CFU and every state context. Software may write an arbitrary
CI selector value to the `mcfu_selector` CSR, addressing any CFU and
any state context. This is sufficient to implement custom interface
multiplexing but does not provide means to protect one hart's CFUs'
state from another hart, nor to limit a hart's access to a given CFU.

When a CPU implements user level and machine level privileged
architecture, an attempt to CSR-write `mcfu_selector` from user level
generates an illegal instruction exception.

Machine level software may provide to user level software an `ECALL`
function to change `mcfu_selector`.

Alternatively, the machine level illegal instruction exception handler
can determine whether the new CI selector value is valid for the user
level code executing on the hart, optionally perform the CSR-write on its
behalf, and return from exception.

Whether `ECALL` or exception handler, a detour into system level
is prohibitively slow: reconfiguring custom interface multiplexing
should take, at most, a few clock cycles.

The optional CFU access control CSRs `mcfu_selector_table` and
`cfu_selector_index` allow less privileged _user code_ to rapidly
multiplex custom interfaces, but only among those interfaces and state
contexts that it is granted access by more privileged _system code_.

CFU access control requires at least user level and machine level
privileged architecture, and a memory access control system, i.e.,
either RISC-V PMP or RISC-V virtual memory access control.

For each hart, the system code provisions a <<selector-table,_CI selector
table_>>, 4 KB aligned, comprising 1024 32-bit CI selectors, which is
read/write to system code and inaccessible from user code. Initially
the table is zero filled, as zero is a valid CI selector ( `.en=0` which
disables custom interface multiplexing). The system code CSR-writes its
address to the hart's `mcfu_selector_table` CSR. Then in response to
a system call requesting access to an interface, and one of its state
contexts, system code determines whether the access is granted. If so,
it determines the CI selector value for it, allocates an entry for that
CI selector value in the CI selector table, and returns the index (the
_selector index)_ of that entry to user code.

[TIP]
====
This index is analogous to a Unix file descriptor -- an opaque token to
a resource granted by system code.
====

To select this CI/CFU and its state, user code CSR-writes its index
to `cfu_selector_index`. In response, the CPU loads from memory (at more
privileged level) the CI selector word at that index in the selector table
and CSR-writes it to `mcfu_selector` -- no exception handling detour
required.

[TIP]
====
This mechanism also conceals the specific CFU_ID and STATE_ID information
from user code, precluding some possible side channel attacks.
