[[cfu-li]]
== Custom Function Unit Logic Interface

The CFU-LI defines a set of common hardware logic signaling interfaces
enabling straightforward, correct composition of CPUs and CFUs. In the
CFU-LI, a CPU is a requester and a CFU is a responder. The CPU sends
a CFU request and eventually receives a CFU response. For each request
there is exactly one response.

=== Definitions

[[cfu_request]]
A *CFU request (request)* is a group of CFU-LI signals that may
include request flow control, <<REQ_ID,REQ_ID>>, <<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>,
<<CF_ID,CF_ID>>, <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>, the raw instruction, and integer
operands, produced by a CFU requester, conveying request data to a CFU.

A *CFU response (response)* is a group of CFU-LI signals that may include
response flow control, <<REQ_ID,REQ_ID>>, response status, and integer
result, produced by a CFU, conveying response data to a CFU requester.

[[REQ_ID]]
A *request ID (REQ_ID)* is a tag (a _magic cookie_) that correlates
a CFU request and its corresponding CFU response.

A *CFU response status (response status, status)* is a CFU-LI
success/error code produced by a CFU in response to receiving a
CFU request, indicating success or else an error in the request's
<<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>, <<CF_ID,CF_ID>>, <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>, operation,
or a custom interface specific error.

A *CFU requester* (requester) is a core that sends CFU requests to CFU(s)
and receives CFU response(s) from CFUs.

A *CPU* is a CFU requester that implements RISC-V RV-I-Zicsr-Zicfu
instruction set, issues CFU requests upon issuing CF instructions,
and writes a destination register and the CFU status CSR in response to
CFU responses.

A *custom function unit (CFU, responder)* is a core that implements
one or more custom interfaces. It receives CFU requests and sends CFU
responses to CFU requesters. A CFU that also issues CFU requests is an
*intermediary CFU*; otherwise it is a *leaf CFU*.

A *Mux CFU (mux)* is an intermediary CFU. For each request received,
the mux either sends a response itself (e.g., a CFU_ERROR_CFU response)
or arbitrates and forwards the request to a subordinate CFU, and later
forwards the corresponding response to the original requester.

A *CFU feature level adapter (adapter)* is an intermediary CFU that
receives requests and sends responses at one CFU-LI feature level and
adapts them for and forwards them to a subordinate CFU with a lesser
feature level.

A *configured system (system)* is a computer system including one or
more CPUs and zero or more CFUs that implement a set of configured
custom interfaces.

=== Example configured system

<<configured-system>> illustrates a configured system composed of two
CPUs and five CFUs, plus a mux, and a level adapter for CFU~3~. Each CPU
has two harts. CFUs 0-2 are stateful and CFUs 3-4 are stateless. Each
stateful CFU has one state context per hart. CFU~1~ has an additional
state context per hart for isolated stateful requests from CFU~2~.

[[configured-system]]
.Configured system composed of two CPUs and five CFUs
image::composed-cfus.png[image,width=360]

In general, a CPU that issues one CFU request per cycle is directly
coupled to one CFU, usually a mux CFU. A system of CFUs forms a directed
acyclic graph.

=== CFU-LI feature levels

The CFU-LI is stratified into separate feature levels: -L0: combinational;
-L1: fixed latency; -L2: variable latency; and -L3: reordering.
Each feature level adds yet more CFU request and response
signals, module ports, and behaviors to the feature level below it.

[TIP]
====
Stratification keeps simple use cases simple and frugal, and makes more
complex use cases possible.
====

==== CFU-L0: combinational CFU

The CFU, which implements a stateless custom interface, computes a
combinational function of the CFU request, sending a CFU response after
some propagation delay. There is no flow control.

[TIP]
====
Example: combinational bitmanip unit with a population count custom function.
====

[[cfu-l1]]
==== CFU-L1: fixed latency CFU

Each cycle, the CFU computes a function of the CFU request *and the
specified state context, if any, updating the context*, sending a
CFU response after a configured *fixed non-negative number of clock
cycles*. With an initiation interval of II=1/cycle, there is no flow
control of requests or responses.

[TIP]
====
Examples: stateless: a pipelined multiplier; stateful: a pipelined
multiply-accumulate unit wherein the state is the current total.
====

[NOTE]
====
Perhaps minimum II should also be configurable, e.g. CFU_INIT_INTERVAL=1+.
====

[[cfu-l2]]
==== CFU-L2: variable latency CFU

The CFU computes a function of the CFU request and the specified state
context, if any, updating the context, sending a CFU response, *in order,
in a later clock cycle*. There is *request and response flow control*
so the CFU can suspend receiving requests and the CPU can suspend
receiving responses.

[TIP]
====
Example: a multiply-divide unit with a variable-latency multi-cycle
divide, with early-out.
====

[[cfu-l3]]
==== CFU-L3: reordering CFU

The CFU computes a function of the CFU request and the specified state
context, if any, updating the context, and sending a CFU response in a
later clock cycle. *Responses for requests with the same state context
are sent in order, otherwise may be sent out of order*. There is request
and response flow control.

CFU-L3 incorporates a <<req-resp-id,request-response ID>> for the
requester to correlate responses received to requests sent.

[TIP]
====
Example: a stateless, variable latency posit floating point unit, which,
having received a pdiv request then a pmul request, responds out of order,
sending the pmul response ahead of the pdiv response.
====

==== Feature levels summary

In summary, all CFU-LI feature levels have request and response function,
data, and status. Level 0 is combinational. Level 1 adds clocking,
fixed latency, and state contexts. Level 2 adds variable latency and
request and response flow control and the raw instruction.
Level 3 adds reordering. (<<levels-table>>.)

[TIP]
====
Compared to all possible subsets of features, CFU-LI levels are
relatively simple and practical. Each level is a superset of lower
levels, simplifying composition of dissimilar CFUs using common CFU
feature level adapters.
====

=== CFU-LI signaling

CFU cores _of a particular feature level_ implement a common set
of request and response signals. <<cfu-signals>> lists all CFU-LI
signals of all feature levels in a canonical order: transaction
signals (request/response valid, ready, <<REQ_ID,REQ_ID>>), context
(<<CFU_ID,CFU_ID>>, <<STATE_ID,STATE_ID>>), function (raw instruction,
<<CF_ID,CF_ID>>), and data. The Level column indicates which levels introduce
which signals. The Dir column indicates the signal direction from the
perspective of a responder. The bit width of each bit vector is determined
by a width parameter, configurable per CFU
(ยง<<parameters>>).

`CFU_LI_VERSION` indicates the version of the CFU-LI signals and semantics
in effect, using semantic versioning
https://semver.org, encoded as `24'hxx_yy_00`: (major=xx,minor=yy,patch=00).
Since `CFU_LI_VERSION` is an interface specification and not an
implementation, there is never a patch level. See also ยง<<versioning>>.

[TIP]
====
`CFU_LI_VERSION` anticipates subsequent evolution of CFU-LI.
====

`CFU_N_CFUS` is the number of logical CFUs at/below this CFU. For
a leaf CFU this may be more than one when the CFU implements multiple
custom interfaces (including multiple versions of one custom interface).

`CFU_N_STATES` is the number of custom interface state contexts for
every stateful interface implemented by this CFU. It must be 0 if every
custom interface implemented by the CFU is stateless. It must be 1+ if
any custom interface implemented by the CFU is stateful. When a leaf CFU
implements multiple stateful custom interfaces, i.e. `CFU_N_CFUS>1`,
each must be configured with the same number of state contexts.

`CFU_LATENCY` and `CFU_RESET_LATENCY` are specific to CFU-L1 fixed
latency CFUs.  See ยง<<cfu-l1>>.

[[clocking]]
==== Clock, reset, clock enable

CFU-L0 is combinational. Other feature levels' signaling is (mostly)
synchronous to rising edge (_posedge_) of `clk`.

When the reset input signal `rst` is asserted on posedge `clk`, it
supersedes all other CFU-LI signaling. Any request processing in
progress is abandoned, all internal state is reset, and `req_ready`
and `resp_valid` output signals, if present, are negated. A CFU-L1 CFU
(which does not have a `req_ready` output) must be ready to receive
its first request after no more than its configured `CFU_RESET_LATENCY`
clock cycles following negation of `rst`.

A clock enable input signal `clk_en` facilitates clock gating of a
CFU. When `clk_en` is asserted on posedge `clk`, synchronous elements of
the CFU (i.e., memories, registers, flip-flops) may change. When `clk_en`
is negated on posedge `clk`, no changes may occur to synchronous elements
of the CFU. CFU operation is suspended. Therefore, when negating `clk_en`,
a CFU requester must disregard all CFU output signals, esp. `req_ready`
and `resp_valid`.

[TIP]
====
In the twilight of Moore's Law, energy efficiency is a first order
design concern, and it is a shame to burn power computing routinely
discarded results.
====

[TIP]
====
All modern FPGAs enable simple clock gating via _free_ `clk_en` inputs
on all LUT-cluster D flip-flops.
====

[TIP]
====
If a requester never clock gates a CFU with `clk_en`, it should assert
`clk_en` with a constant `'1`. FPGA and ASIC implementation tools typically
optimize away such signals and their D flip-flop clock enables.
====

[NOTE]
====
Perhaps provide another configuration parameter `CFU_USE_CLK_EN=0/1` to
configurably-ignore `clk_en`. This could simplify conversion of
preexisting RTL function units, sans `clk_en` gating, into new CFUs.
====

[[flow-control]]
==== Request and response valid-ready flow control

CFU-L2 and -L3 provide CFU request and response channel synchronous
valid-ready flow control. For each channel, the sender may assert data
and a positive-true data `valid` signal indicating it is ready to send
data. The receiver may assert a positive-true `ready` signal indicating it
is ready to receive data. On posedge `clk`, if both `valid` and `ready` are
asserted, data transfers from sender to receiver; otherwise, no transfer
occurs during that clock cycle.

Once a sender asserts data and asserts data `valid` on posedge `clk`,
it must assert the same data and `valid` on each subsequent posedge `clk`
until the receiver asserts `ready` and the transfer occurs.

A `valid` output must not depend (via combinational logic) upon a `ready`
input. However, a `ready` output may depend upon a `valid` input.

With request and response flow control, a requester must not indefinitely
negate `resp_ready` in response to a responder negating `req_ready`.

[TIP]
====
This precludes a potential cyclical wait deadlock in a composed system.
====

[[error-checking]]
==== Response status / error checking

At any feature level, in response to receiving a CFU request, the CFU
error-checks the request data, performs the request, and outputs the first
(i.e., lowest numbered) `[2:0] resp_status` condition that applies:

.CFU response status values and conditions
[width="100%",cols="23%,7%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Value |Condition
|`CFU_OK` |0 |no errors occurred processing request
|`CFU_ERROR_CFU` |1 |`req_cfu` is not a CFU_ID implemented by CFU
|`CFU_ERROR_STATE` |2 |`req_state` is not a valid STATE_ID for `req_cfu`
|`CFU_ERROR_OFF` |3 |`req_state` is valid but this <<serializable,_serializable_>> state context is in the _off_ state
|`CFU_ERROR_FUNC` |4 |`req_func` is not a valid CF_ID for `req_cfu`
|`CFU_ERROR_OP` |5 |request operand(s) or state are a domain error for the custom function
|`CFU_ERROR_CUSTOM` |6 |request causes a custom error (of a serializable custom interface)
|===

When parameter `CPU_CFU_ID_W=0`, `req_cfu` is ignored: no `CFU_ERROR_CFU`
errors.

When parameter `CPU_STATE_ID_W=0`, `req_state` is ignored: no
`CFU_ERROR_STATE` errors.

`STATE_ID=0` is the only valid STATE_ID for the CFU of a stateless
custom interface.

CFU state may change if and only if the response status is one of
`CFU_OK`, `CFU_ERROR_OP`, or `CFU_ERROR_CUSTOM`.

[TIP]
====
When a response status is `CFU_ERROR_CUSTOM`, the CFU should update
the specified state context's custom error status as a side effect of
the request. Otherwise, a CI library may be surprised to observe that the
custom error bit `cfu_status.CU` is set without observing a corresponding
error bit upon retrieving (via `cfu_read_status`) its state context's
error state.
====

In response to receiving `resp_status` of `CFU_ERROR_CFU`,
`CFU_ERROR_STATE`, `CFU_ERROR_OFF`, or `CFU_ERROR_FUNC`, a CPU ignores
`resp_data` and uses zero as the result of the CF instruction.

When a CF instruction writes a destination register, (i.e.,
`custom-0`/`-1` but not `custom-2`), the result of the CF instruction
is written to the register, irrespective of the CFU response status.

[TIP]
====
Can certain errors suppress destination register writes? No: data
dependent writeback cancelation is irregular and unnecessarily complicates
out of order CPUs.
====

[TIP]
====
Together these rules ensure { CFU, state, function } ID errors are
well behaved at the hardware-software interface. By making the CPU
responsible for zeroing such results, each CFU in a system's CFU DAG
need not incur redundant logic and delay to respond `resp_data=0` on
these three errors. For synchronously signaled CFU-LI levels, in an FPGA,
with reset-able flip-flops, a registered `resp_data` input may be zeroed
for negligible cost.
====

[[raw-insn]]
==== Raw instruction

At CFU-LI feature level 2, or higher, CFU requests may be configured
(`CFU_INSN_W=32`) to include the raw instruction word (`req_insn`) of
the CF instruction issued the CFU request, if the request originates
from a CF instruction, or all zeroes otherwise. A CFU may use the raw
instruction data to help perform a custom function, or it may ignore
the raw instruction entirely.

[TIP]
====
The raw instruction complements the <<CF_ID,CF_ID>> (`req_func`)
identifier. CF_ID is the preferred, future proof way to select a custom
function. It is ISA neutral and abstracts the CPU away from CFU, and
potentially reduces verification complexity.
====

[TIP]
====
However, access to the raw CF instruction word can enable additional
use cases. As an example, consider a CFU with a private vector, matrix,
or complex number register file. When this CFU receives a CFU request
including its raw instruction word, it may opt to ignore either or
both of the two integer request operands `req_data0` and `req_data1`,
and instead partially decode the raw instruction word to recover `rs1`
and `rs2` fields, even `rs3` if there are spare CF instruction bits,
to determine which of its CFU register file entries to read. Similarly,
the CFU can decode the raw instruction word to recover an `rd` field
to determine which CFU-private register file entry to write back and
whether to do so.
====

[TIP]
====
This feature is best used with the <<custom-2,`custom-2`>> flex
instruction format which has no `rd` destination register field,
freeing those bits for arbitrary uses.
====

[NOTE]
====
Does raw instruction access merits security threat modeling?  Imagine
adversarial CFUs, snoopily watching the dynamic instruction stream go by,
even when `req_valid` is negated.
====

[NOTE]
====
Half-baked idea (not recommended):
Imagine a dynamic facility by which any arbitrary instruction word, not
just `custom-0`/`-1`/`-2` format instructions, may be a CF instruction,
issued to a CFU.
This might be a table of (mask,pattern) tuples, or a 32-bit
`mcfu_opcodes_mask` CSR bit vector of 5-bit major opcodes, identifying
instructions to divert to the current CFU. Or perhaps, in the hardware
domain, a CPU might first issue each instruction to the current CFU, and
only execute the instruction in the CPU if the CFU delegates it back to
the CPU.
====

[[req-resp-id]]
==== Request-response ID

CFU-LI feature level 3 <<cfu-l3,(reordering CFU)>> includes a request-response
ID <<REQ_ID,REQ_ID>>, a `REQ_ID_W` -bit signal used by requesters to
correlate responses received with requests sent. With each request, the
CFU receives the REQ_ID as `req_id`, and later, with each response, the
CFU sends back the same REQ_ID as `resp_id`. For each request/response
pair, the CFU must send the requester the identical request-response ID
value that the requester previously sent to the CFU.

Operation and behavior of a CFU must not depend in any way upon any
`req_id` value received, except to receive it and later to return it
to the requester.

[TIP]
====
An out-of-order completion CPU may send a REQ_ID indicating the
destination register of the request, and rely upon it when the response
eventually returns.
====

=== CFU-L0 combinational CFU signaling

A combinational CFU, which implements a stateless custom interface,
computes a combinational function of the CFU request, sending a CFU
response after some propagation delay. There is no flow control.

CFU-L0 signaling is asynchronous. CFU outputs are pure combinational functions of CFU inputs.

[TIP]
====
CFU-L0 has no `resp_valid` signal because it would just reflect `req_valid`.
====

==== CFU-L0 signaling protocol

Protocol:

[arabic]
. Request transfer
[loweralpha]
.. Requester asserts CFU request signals `req_*` and asserts `req_valid`.
.. CFU asynchronously receives CFU request.
. Response transfer
[loweralpha]
.. CFU performs steps 1, 2, 4, and 6 of response status / error checking per ยง<<error-checking>>, and asserts `resp_status`.
.. CFU asserts `resp_data`, a combinational custom function of the operands.
.. Requester asynchronously receives CFU response.

As a CFU-L0 CFU is combinational, its delay folds into to the path timing
analysis of its requester.

<<cfu-l0-wave>> is an example waveform for three CFU-L0 requests
and responses, arising from executing CF instructions `f0(a0,b0)`,
`f1(a1,b1)`, and `f2(a2,b2)`. All three instructions issue to the same
CFU `u0`.  Function `f1` incurs an error.

=== CFU-L1 fixed latency CFU signaling

Each cycle, a fixed latency CFU computes a function of the CFU request
*and the specified state context, if any, updating the context*, sending
a CFU response after a configured *fixed non-negative number of clock
cycles*. With an initiation interval of II=1/cycle, there is no flow
control of requests or responses.

Lacking request flow control, if a CFU-L1 CFU is configured with multiple
requesters, requesters must not send multiple simultaneous requests.

|===

For `CFU_LI_VERSION`, `CFU_N_CFUS`, and `CFU_N_STATES`, see ยง<<parameters>>.

`CFU_LATENCY`, specific to CFU-L1, configures the CFU latency, which
is the number of clock cycles from receiving a request to sending a
response, of every custom function implemented by the CFU. `CFU_LATENCY=0`
configures the CFU to respond to the request in the same clock cycle.

A CFI-L1 CFU with `CFU_LATENCY=0` resembles a CFU-L0 combinational
CFU, except it may implement a stateful custom interface.

[TIP]
====
Example: an extended precision arithmetic CFU which implements
`add_save_carry` and `add_with_carry_save_carry` CF instructions. Like
an ALU, this has zero cycle latency, but supports additional state
context(s), each with a carry bit.
====

`CFU_RESET_LATENCY`, specific to CFU-L1, configures the CFU reset latency,
which is the minimum number of clock cycles from negation of `rst`
to first assertion of `req_valid`. `CFU_RESET_LATENCY=0` configures
the CFU to be ready for a CFU request in the same cycle that `rst`
is first negated.

<<cfu-l1-wave>> is an example waveform for four CFU-L1 CFU requests and
responses, arising from executing four CF instructions `f0`-`f3`. Since
`CFU_RESET_LATENCY=0`, the CFU is ready for request `f0` in cycle 1, the
same cycle `rst` is negated. With `CFU_LATENCY=2`, each response occurs 2
(enabled) clock cycles after each request is received. Each instruction
issues a CFU request to the same CFU `u0`. Instructions `f0` and `f1` use
state context s0; `f2` and `f3` use state context `s2`. Request `f1` results
in an error response. With `clk_en` negated in cycles 6-19, the CFU is
frozen until cycle 20, when it finally receives the `f3` request. The `f2`
response, otherwise due in cycle 7, is also delayed, until cycle 21.

=== CFU-L2 variable latency CFU signaling

A variable latency CFU computes a function of a CFU request and the specified
state context, if any, updating the context, sending a CFU response,
in order, in a later clock cycle. There is *request and response flow
control* so the CFU can suspend receiving requests and the requester
can suspend receiving responses.

[TIP]
====
When the requester is a CPU, use of CFU-L2 allows the CPU to delay receipt
of a CFU response. This affords the CPU pipeline greater flexibility
to dynamically prioritize other units' accesses to register file write
port(s). Conversely, CFU-L2 can complicate design of a CFU, which may
have to respond to negated `resp_ready` by buffering the response in an
output FIFO or by applying back pressure through its processing pipeline,
or negate `req_ready` to delay receipt of new requests.

The CFU receives request `f0` in cycle 2 and responds in cycle 3.

Requester asserts request `f1` in cycle 3, but it is not received by
the CFU until it asserts `req_ready` in cycle 4. The CFU sends the `f1`
response in cycle 6, an error response, a latency of 2 cycles. Requester
asserts `resp_ready` and receives the response in cycle 7.

Requester asserts request `f2` in cycle 6, but it is not received by
the CFU until it asserts `req_ready` in cycle 7. The CFU responds to
`f2` in cycle 21, a latency of 14 cycles.

Requester asserts request `f3` in cycle 21, and the CFU responds in
cycle 22.

=== CFU-L3 reordering CFU signaling

A reordering CFU computes a function of the CFU request and the specified
state context, if any, updating the context, and sending a CFU response
in a later clock cycle. *Responses for requests with the same context
are sent in order, otherwise may be sent out of order*. There is request
and response flow control.

CFU-L3 incorporates a <<req-resp-id,request-response ID>> for the
requester to correlate responses received to requests sent.

[TIP]
====
This CFU-LI feature level is motivated by past experience building
floating point CFUs. Different functions, e.g., comparison, conversion,
multiplication, addition, division, and square root, exhibit a wide range
of latencies. Some functions, e.g. addition and multiplication, may be
pipelined and afford an initiation interval II=1/cycle, while others,
e.g. division and square root, may be variable latency and perform one
request at a time.

Particularly when a custom interface is stateless and when the requester
(e.g., an in-order-issue/out-of-order completion CPU) tolerates out
of order responses, response reordering can improve performance and
simplify CFU logic by reducing average CFU latency, enabling greater
CFU parallelism, and reducing request blocking and response queueing.
====

[TIP]
====
When a custom interface is stateful, response reordering cannot occur
for any sequence of requests with the same state context, to ensure
identical response data and program behavior over time and over different
CFU implementations of the same custom interface.

==== CFU-L3 example

<<cfu-l3-wave>> is an example waveform for four CFU-L3 CFU requests,
illustrating two different valid out-of-order response sequences, arising
from executing four CF instructions `f0`-`f3`. (Assume `CFU_INSN_W=0`,
no `req_insn`.) Each instruction issues a CFU request to the same CFU
`u0`, but with various state contexts `s0`, `s1`, `s0` (again), and
`s3`. This constrains the CFU to respond to request `f0` with state
`s0`, before responding to subsequent request `f2` for state `s0`.

Note that each CFU request is tagged with a `req_id`, a value that is returned
by the CFU with the corresponding `resp_id`, and used by the requester to
correlate responses to requests and recover the reordering as necessary.

In the first example response, with signals labeled _Response_, the
CFU receives requests (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`) but responds in order
(`f1`, `f3`, `f0`, `f2`). In the second example response, with signals
labeled _Another Ordering_, the CFU responds in order (`f3`, `f0`,
`f2`, `f1`). Bother orderings are valid because they preserve the order
`f0`<`f2` caused by these two CFU requests using the same state `s0`.

=== CFU feature level adapters

A CFU feature level adapter is an intermediary CFU that receives requests
and sends responses at one CFU-LI feature level and adapts them for and
forwards them to a subordinate CFU at a lower CFU-LI feature level.

CFU-LI includes a set of configurable adapters to raise any CFU to any
higher feature level, easing composition:

* `Cvt01`: raise L0 to L1: add configurable latency pipelining
* `Cvt02`, `Cvt12`: raise L0 or L1 to L2: add request-response flow control (may suspend requests)

[NOTE]
====
TODO: Describe the L3 adapters, which are just L2 adapters with a
<<req-resp-id,request-response ID>> FIFO.
====

==== `Cvt01`: raise CFU-L0 to CFU-L1

A `Cvt01` adapter CFU implements CFU-L1, including its configuration
parameters (ยง<<_cfu_l1_configuration_parameters>>), adapting L1 requests
to and responses from a subordinate combinational L0 CFU.

When `CFU_LATENCY=0`, the adapter's request/response channels are directly
coupled to the subordinate CFU request/response channels. Otherwise,
these channels I/Os are registered and pipelined, with a total latency of
`CFU_LATENCY` cycles.

[TIP]
====
Automatic pipeline retiming may _slice_ the combinational logic cone
into several pipeline stages, achieving higher frequency operation.
====

==== `Cvt02`: raise CFU-L0 to CFU-L2

A `Cvt02` adapter CFU implements CFU-L2, including its configuration
parameters (ยง<<_cfu_l2_configuration_parameters>>), adapting L2 requests
to and responses from a subordinate combinational L0 CFU. The adapter
has a fixed latency of one cycle -- a response is sent one cycle after
a request is received.

[TIP]
====
To avoid arbitrary CFU response queuing, yet keep signaling simple and
frugal, the `Cvt02` adapter might negate `req_ready` on any cycle that it
has a valid response waiting (asserting `resp_valid`) and the requester
negates `resp_ready`.
====

==== `Cvt12`: raise CFU-L1 to CFU-L2

A `Cvt12` adapter CFU implements CFU-L2, including its configuration
parameters (ยง<<_cfu_l2_configuration_parameters>>), plus `CFU_LATENCY`
(ยง<<_cfu_l1_configuration_parameters>>), adapting L2 requests to and
responses from a subordinate fixed latency L1 CFU.

The `CFU_LATENCY` parameter, which specifies the latency of the
_subordinate L1 CFU_, typically configures the depth of a response
FIFO -- an entire response stream must be buffered when the requester,
having just issued `CFU_LATENCY` of requests to the L1 CFU, negates
`resp_ready` through as many clock cycles. Eventually, with response
transfers paused, the response FIFO fills and the adapter CFU negates
`req_ready`.

When `CFU_LATENCY=0`, the subordinate CFU response must be registered
and therefore the adapter's response latency is at least one cycle.

[[cpus]]
=== CFU-LI-compliant CPUs

A CFU-LI-compliant CPU implements RISC-V RV-I -Zicsr *-Zicfu* instruction
set, sends CFU requests upon issuing CF instructions, and writes a
destination register and CFU status CSR in response to CFU responses.

==== CPUs and CFU-LI feature levels

CPUs, as CFU requesters, use specific CFU-LI feature levels.

[TIP]
====
An austere single-cycle CPU might use CFU-L0 with a combinational CFU
(only).

A pipelined in-order CPU might use CFU-L1 with a fixed latency CFU
configured for (e.g.) 2 cycles latency. It might also use CFU-L2 with
a variable latency CFU, stalling the pipeline during cycles where CF
instructions cannot issue because the selected CFU negates `req_ready`,
and itself negating `resp_ready` during write-back cycles when the
register file's write port or other necessary resource is unavaiable.

An out-of-order completion CPU, i.e. one that may commit low latency
instructions before prior high latency insturctions, might issue CF
instructions to a CFU-L2 variable latency CFU and in some future cycle
retire the variable latency CFU response, here again negating `resp_ready`
when it is unable to accept a response to writeback.

An OoO completion CPU, that handles reordered CFU responses, might use
a CFU-L3 reordering CFU.
====

A CPU may have one or more sets of CFU request and response ports. For each
such set, a CPU may send zero or one CFU request per cycle and receive
zero or one CFU response per cycle.

[TIP]
====
Most CPUs send up to one request and receive up to one response. However,
a CFU-LI compliant superscalar CPU might send multiple CFU requests
and receive multiple CFU responses, to multiple CFUs of the same, or
different, CFU-LI feature levels, in parallel, in the same cycle.
====

=== Example: CFU signaling in a composed system

Consider <<mux22>>, a system composed from two single-hart CPUs, two
stateful CFUs, and a 2-input, 2-output Mux CFU. Fixed latency CFU~0~
implements CFU-L1, configured with `CFU_LATENCY=1`. The CPUs, CFU~1~,
and `Mux22` use/implement CFU-L2. `Cvt12`, a CFU level converter,
up-converts CFU~0~ from CFU-L1 to CFU-L2.

[[mux22]]
.CFU-L2 system, with two CPUs, mux CFU, converter CFU, CFU~0~ (L1), and CFU~1~ (L2)
image::cfu-mux22.png[image,width=400]

With one hart per CPU, the custom interfaces' CFUs are configured
with two state contexts each (<2>).

Both CPU~0~ and CPU~1~ are configured to issue CF instructions mapping
CI_ID~0~ -> CFU_ID=0 -> CFU~0~ and CI_ID~1~ -> CFU_ID=1 -> CFU~1~.

The exemplary 2x2 Mux CFU is frugal, if low frequency, while sustaining
one cycle initiation interval transfers of requests and responses. It
multiplexes downstream request transfers and upstream response
transfers. In both directions, the mux consists of input ports (not
registered), output port registers, an approximately fair output port
arbiter, and a 2x2 channel crossbar. Each cycle, the mux determines
which output ports are _available_ (i.e., are empty, or will transfer
(`valid & ready`) this cycle) and which valid inputs are _eligible_
to transfer, then asserts ready, and transfers, some eligible inputs to
available output ports, based upon a rotating priority order.

A _request_ input port is eligible to transfer if it is valid and if
the target `req_cfu` CFU_ID is the same as the last request, or if there
are no pending responses for this port. This ensures that responses for
requests, routed to different CFUs with different latencies, are always
returned in order to the requester, as required by CFU-L2.

Downstream request routing is per the request inputs' `req_cfu` elements:
CFU_ID=0 routes to the first output port and CFU_ID=1 routes to the
second output port. The mux itself responds to requests with invalid
CFU_IDs with a `CFU_ERROR_CFU` response.

For upstream response routing, the Mux incorporates, for each subordinate
CFU, a FIFO queue that records the requester port ID that issued each
request to that CFU.  As each (in order) response from that CFU is
received, the requester port ID is dequeued from that FIFO and used to
route the response to its corresponding requester.

In this example, assume each CPU decouples issue and commit using
a scoreboarded register file enabling arbitrary interface unit
latencies. Each CPU runs the same code (<<cim3>>):

[arabic]
. Write `mcfu_selector` for CFU_ID=0 and STATE_ID=__HART_ID__, issue two CF instructions to CFU~0~;
. Write `mcfu_selector` for CFU_ID=1 and STATE_ID=__HART_ID__, issue two CF instructions to CFU~1~;
. Write `mcfu_selector` for CFU_ID=0 and STATE_ID=__HART_ID__, issue one CF instruction to CFU~0~.

[[cim3]]
.Issue stateful CF instructions `f0` and `f1` to CFU~0~, `f2` and `f3` to CFU~1~, and `f4` to CFU~0~ again.

<<mux22-wave>> is an example waveform executing <<cim3>>
near-simultaneously on the two CPUs of <<mux22>>.

(_1:u2<3>.f4_ denotes CFU request #1 with CFU_ID=2 STATE_ID=3 CF_ID=4)

In the narrative that follows, that _A sends B_ means _A asserts B
ahead of next posedge `clk`,_ whereas _B transfers to C_ means _during
this cycle C receives and accepts it_. Recall with CFU-L2, request
transfers occur when both `req_valid` and `req_ready` are asserted
(ยง<<flow-control>>), and response transfers occur when `resp_valid`
and `resp_ready` are asserted.

=== Composing CFUs with AXI4-Streams

In some configured systems, preexisting infrastructure components
that implement AXI4-Stream protocol may be used to help compose CPUs
and CFUs. A fully flow controlled CFU-LI -L2 or -L3 transfer may be
transported over two AXI4-Stream (AXI-S) streams, one for requests and
one for responses.

[TIP]
====
For example, in a AMD/Xilinx Versal FPGA, a CPU might transfer CFU
requests, via CFU-L2-to-AXI-S bridge, AXI-S-to-NOC bridge, Versal NOC,
NOC-to-AXI-S bridge, AXI-S-to-CFU-L2 bridge, to a CFU at the far corner
of the FPGA fabric, later transferring CFU responses back to the _distant_
CPU by the same means.

<<cfu-axis>> presents a recommended canonical mapping between CFU-LI
signals and the two AXI-S streams.

|===

When several CFU-LI signals map to a single AXI-S port, the signals
are to be concatenated in order, each signal assigned successively more
significant bits. For example, using Verilog concatenation:

[code,verilog]
....
reqs_tuser = { req_insn,req_func,req_state,req_cfu };
reqs_tdata = { req_data1,req_data0 };
....

Use `reqs_tdest` when `req_id` and/or `req_cfu` indicate/encode a
specific AXI-S destination (of a bridge to a CFU).  Use `resps_tdest`
when of `resp_id` indicates a specific AXI-S destination (of a bridge
to a requester, e.g., CPU).
