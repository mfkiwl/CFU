CFU Zoo
=======

This work-in-progress directory will provide various example CFUs, standard mux and adapter CFUs,
CFU-LI compatible CPUs, and composed systems.

The various testbenches require `cocotb` `cocotb-test` `pytest-xdist` `iverilog` `verilator-4.106`.
Planning to automate setup and execution using `tox`.

Until then, any testbench may be run with
`
[SIM=[icarus|verilator]] pytest -n auto <cfu>_test.py
`
RTL code may only use the subset of System Verilog that is implemented by Icarus Verilog and
Verilator, and must be free of warnings, esp. Verilator lint warnings.

Current CFU examples:

| CFU          | level | stateful | serializ. | comments            |
|--------------|-------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| popcount_cfu | L0    | -        | -         | -                   |
| bnn_cfu      | L0    | -        | -         | reuses popcount_cfu |
| mulacc_cfu   | L1    | yes      | yes       | -                   |
| dotprod_cfu  | L1    | yes      | yes       | -                   |
