CXU Zoo
=======

This work-in-progress directory will provide various example CXUs, standard mux and adapter CXUs,
CXU-LI compatible CPUs, and composed systems.

The various testbenches require `cocotb` `cocotb-test` `pytest-xdist` `iverilog`
and `iverilog v12_0 (stable)` and `verilator-4.106` or `verilator-5.006+`.
Planning to automate setup and execution using `tox`.

Until then, any testbench may be run with
`
[SIM=[icarus|verilator]] pytest -n auto <cxu>_test.py
`
RTL code may only use the subset of System Verilog that is implemented by Icarus Verilog and
Verilator, and must be free of warnings, esp. Verilator lint warnings.

Current CXU examples:
